    <h>Story Telling Fifa World Cup</h>

    <p>Faaz Arshad </p>

    <p>Motivation: </p>

    <p>I was motivated to do this project because I love soccer. My favorite team is Liverpool FC and PSG. The country I
        support is my home country, USMNT. The league in the US isnâ€™t that popular or strong as compared to the other top five leagues around the world.
        There is the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1.
        There are many other leagues around the world that have players that participate in the world cup but the
        majority of the star players come from these top five leagues. These star players end up playing for
        their national team and causes the national team to become stronger than usual.
        These national teams go on to compete at the world cup to claim that they are the best country
        the sport has to offer. Having already watched a few world cups in my lifetime,
        I thought that it would be a fun experience for me to showcase my love and appreciation to the sport
        and what better way is it than to discuss and visualize the best tournament in the world. </p>

    <p>Objectives: </p>

    <p>The main objective of this project is to tell a story of the competition and determine which
        FIFA World Cup was the best by visualizing the data of each world cup. </p>

<p>Conclusion: </p>

<p>The main objective of this project was to tell a story of the competition and determine which
    FIFA World Cup was the best by visualizing the data of each world cup. Based off of the results from
    the charts, the year that was the best world cup was 1998. The team that won in the year of 1998 was
    France. France played a total of 64 matches, had 171 goals with 2,785,000 attendies. Surprisingly,based
    off of the data set WorldCup.csv, France only won one world cup in between the years 1930-2014.
